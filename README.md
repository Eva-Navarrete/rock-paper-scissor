## Overview and Project Goals
The [goal](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/intention-timer-group.html) of this group project that was made for Mod1 at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/) is to build a Rock Paper Scissor's Game from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.

## Why was this project created?
To solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:
1. writing clean and DRY HTML, CSS, and JS
2. understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
3. the interaction between multiple class files
4. implementation of client-side data persistence by utilizing JSON and localStorage

## Features
* A website that allows users to play a Classic Game of Rock, Paper, Scissor but with a twist of Studio Ghibli characters/fighters.
Haku, Spritz, Calcifer for classic and an addition of Totoro, and No Face for difficult.
Lose yourself in this magically themed game.
